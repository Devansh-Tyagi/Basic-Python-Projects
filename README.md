# Basic-Python-Projects
The following repository consists of some of my daily base python projects :
1. tic tac toe - TIC TAC TOE game project. Allows 2 players to play on board at once and declares the winner at last if found any, otherwise gives a TIE/DRAW statement.
2. ticket generator - The following programme asks the user for source place and destination place and number of tickets he/she want to withdraw. In return gives the ticket 
   printed in a specific format including flight number/source code/destination code/ticket number.
